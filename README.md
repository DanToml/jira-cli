# jira-cli
_a simple CLI for interacting with jira._

It aims to be a lightweight tool for the tasks that I personally perform on a
regular basis, but contributions from others are welcome.

## Initial Design Goals

- Intuitive flow for issue creation
- Issue Search
- Kanban boards
- User friendly and scriptable output modes
